# rego-policies
[Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/) policies collection.

## Policies
For a full list of policies, see the auto-generated [POLICIES.md](POLICIES.md)

The naming of the policies follows the Gatekeeper format, as described [here.](https://github.com/plexsystems/konstraint/blob/main/docs/constraint_creation.md#resource-naming)

## Tools
### Conftest
conftest is a CLI to execute rego policies. It can be used to test locally before pushing to [OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/).
- [https://www.conftest.dev/install](https://www.conftest.dev/install/)

### OPA Playground
OPA provides a web based playground, which can highlight which lines have been activated. Having issues with your policy? check it out with "Coverage" enabled:
