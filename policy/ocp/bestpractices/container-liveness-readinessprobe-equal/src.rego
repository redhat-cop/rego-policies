# @title Container liveness and readiness probes are equal
#
# When Liveness and Readiness probes are pointing to the same endpoint, the effects of the probes are combined.
# When the app signals that it's not ready or live, the kubelet detaches the container from the Service and delete it at the same time.
# You might notice dropping connections because the container does not have enough time to drain the current connections or process the incoming ones.
