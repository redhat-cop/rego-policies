# @title RHCOP-OCP_BESTPRACT-00016: Container secret not mounted as envs
#
# The content of Secret resources should be mounted into containers as volumes rather than passed in as environment variables.
# This is to prevent that the secret values appear in the command that was used to start the container, which may be inspected
# by individuals that shouldn't have access to the secret values.
# See: Configuration and secrets -> https://learnk8s.io/production-best-practices#application-development
