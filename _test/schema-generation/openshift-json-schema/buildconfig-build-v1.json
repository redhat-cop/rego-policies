  "description": "Build configurations define a build process for new container images. There are three types of builds possible - a container image build using a Dockerfile, a Source-to-Image build that uses a specially prepared base image that accepts source code that it can make runnable, and a custom build that can run // arbitrary container images as a base and accept the build parameters. Builds run on the cluster and on completion are pushed to the container image registry specified in the \"output\" section. A build can be triggered via a webhook, when the base image changes, or when a user manually requests a new build be // created.\n\nEach build created by a build configuration is numbered and refers back to its parent configuration. Multiple builds can be triggered at once. Builds that do not have \"output\" set can be used to test code or run a verification build.\n\nCompatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).",

The hook executes a command in a temporary container running the build output image, immediately after the last layer of the image is committed and before the image is pushed to a registry. The command is executed with the current working directory ($PWD) set to the image's WORKDIR.\n\nThe build will be marked as failed if the hook execution fails. It will fail if the script or command return a non-zero exit code, or if there is any other error related to starting the temporary container.\n\nThere are five different ways to configure the hook. As an example, all forms below are equivalent and will execute `rake test --verbose`.\n\n1. Shell script:\n\n\t   \"postCommit\": {\n\t     \"script\": \"rake test --verbose\",\n\t   }\n\n\tThe above is a convenient form which is equivalent to:\n\n\t   \"postCommit\": {\n\t     \"command\": [\"/bin/sh\", \"-ic\"],\n\t     \"args\":    [\"rake test --verbose\"]\n\t   }\n\n2. A command as the image entrypoint:\n\n\t   \"postCommit\": {\n\t     \"commit\": [\"rake\", \"test\", \"--verbose\"]\n\t   }\n\n\tCommand overrides the image entrypoint in the exec form, as documented in\n\tDocker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint.\n\n3. Pass arguments to the default entrypoint:\n\n\t       \"postCommit\": {\n\t\t\t      \"args\": [\"rake\", \"test\", \"--verbose\"]\n\t\t      }\n\n\t    This form is only useful if the image entrypoint can handle arguments.\n\n4. Shell script with arguments:\n\n\t   \"postCommit\": {\n\t     \"script\": \"rake test $1\",\n\t     \"args\":   [\"--verbose\"]\n\t   }\n\n\tThis form is useful if you need to pass arguments that would otherwise be\n\thard to quote properly in the shell script. In the script, $0 will be\n\t\"/bin/sh\" and $1, $2, etc, are the positional arguments from Args.\n\n5. Command with arguments:\n\n\t   \"postCommit\": {\n\t     \"command\": [\"rake\", \"test\"],\n\t     \"args\":    [\"--verbose\"]\n\t   }\n\n\tThis form is equivalent to appending the arguments to the Command slice.\n\nIt is invalid to provide both Script and Command simultaneously. If none of the fields are specified, the hook is not executed.",
