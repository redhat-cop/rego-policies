  "description": "Deployment Configs define the template for a pod and manages deploying new images or configuration changes. A single deployment configuration is usually analogous to a single micro-service. Can support many different deployment patterns, including full restart, customizable rolling updates, and  fully custom behaviors, as well as pre- and post- deployment hooks. Each individual deployment is represented as a replication controller.\n\nA deployment is \"triggered\" when its configuration is changed or a tag in an Image Stream is changed. Triggers can be disabled to allow manual control over a deployment. The \"strategy\" determines how the deployment is carried out and may be changed at any time. The `latestVersion` field is updated when a new deployment is triggered by any means.\n\nCompatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).",

And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains, this value has no effect on scheduling. As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains, scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains. If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1. Valid values are integers greater than 0. When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.\n\nFor example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  | The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so \"global minimum\" is treated as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones, it will violate MaxSkew.\n\nThis is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).",
