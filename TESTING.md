# Testing
This repo uses as a combination of [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core), [conftest](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/conftest) and
[gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper) to validate the rego policies.

## How do I write a policy?
Each policy lives under its own directory, i.e.: [policy/ocp/bestpractices/common-k8s-labels-notset](policy/ocp/bestpractices/common-k8s-labels-notset).
Every policy must have a test_data directory; within that directory, there should be:
- unit: should contain only the YAML needed to execute the policy, i.e.: a cut down version
- integration: should contain valid YAML which can be deployed to a cluster which only triggers the policy under-test

Each policy must have a BATS test executed by its usecase:
- unit test files will be executed by [_test/conftest-unittests.sh](_test/conftest-unittests.sh).
- integration test files will be executed by [_test/gatekeeper-integrationtests.sh](_test/gatekeeper-integrationtests.sh). 

Each policy, if applicable, must have an `opa eval --profile` test executed by [_test/opa-profile.sh](_test/opa-profile.sh).

## Execute unit tests
```bash
bats _test/conftest-unittests.sh
```

## Execute profile tests
```bash
bats _test/opa-profile.sh
```

## Execute integration units
```bash
_test/deploy-gatekeeper.sh deploy_gatekeeper
_test/deploy-gatekeeper.sh deploy_constraints
bats _test/gatekeeper-integrationtests.sh
```

### Limit Gatekeeper to integration test project only
By default, Gatekeeper watches all projects, unless they are labeled `control-plane` or `admission.gatekeeper.sh/ignore`.
If you only want Gatekeeper to watch the project created by [_test/gatekeeper-integrationtests.sh](_test/gatekeeper-integrationtests.sh),
run the below before `deploy_constraints`:

```bash
_test/deploy-gatekeeper.sh patch_namespaceselector
```
